Easily and safely embed a syntax-highlighted source code within pages and posts on your WordPress website without losing its formatting.


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely embed a syntax-highlighted source code within pages and posts on your WordPress website without losing its formatting.

This plugin supports 13 languages, 16 shortcodes and 36 themes. The syntax highlighting feature is implemented using the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) library.

Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. Syntax highlighting is one strategy to improve the readability and context of the text; especially for code that spans several pages. The reader can easily ignore large sections of comments or code, depending on what they are looking for.

This plugin also uses standalone Shortcode-Processor to prevent WordPress from converting newlines to HTML paragraphs, replacing apostrophes with typographic quotes and so on.

This plugin is just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start using your new shortcodes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my wordpress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (wordpress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. It is also possible that not all existing translations are up-to-date or correct, so you are welcome to make corrections. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

If you want to help translate this plugin, please use the POT file that is included and placed in the `languages` folder to create a translation PO file. Just [send the PO file to us](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and we will include this translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy the fancy syntax highlighting on your website. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Syntax Highlighter`".

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly. The most common reason for this is a web browser’s cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser’s cache. Clearing your browser’s cache may solve the problem.

If you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
A. Any suggestions are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and share. Thank you!

= Q. I love this plugin! Can I help somehow? =
A. Yes, any contributions are very welcome! Please visit [our donation page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/donate.html). Thank you!
